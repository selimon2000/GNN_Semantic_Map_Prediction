# GNN Semantic Map Prediction

*A Capstone Project on Predicting Partially Explored Semantic Maps using Graph Neural Networks*

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on **translating partially explored semantic maps into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to predict unknown nodes (e.g., rooms, objects) in an environment. It serves as a novel approach for robotic mapping and autonomous exploration.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Graph-based Representation**: Converts semantic maps into graph structures for GNN processing.
- **Unknown Node Prediction**: Uses GNNs to infer missing nodes in partially explored environments.
- **Robotic Applications**: Enhances autonomous navigation and mapping in unknown spaces.

## ï¿½ Motivation

> *"How can robots predict unexplored areas in real-time using semantic mapping?"*
> This project bridges the gap between **semantic mapping** and **deep learning** by leveraging GNNs to improve robotic environment understanding
